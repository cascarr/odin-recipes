                <h2>Isi Ewu Delicacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Isi ewu "Goat head" is a popular delicacy from ala
                    Igbo Eastern Nigeria. It is similar to Nkwobi, but
                    slightly different due to the type and part of meat
                    used. This delicacy is best eaten with a glass of
                    palm wine along side.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Before preparing isi ewu, it's very important to
                        note that it's difficult to cut open the goat head.
                        So, before properly cooking it, there must be a first
                        cook to soften it, for the parts to be easily cut and
                        sauced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Goat head is usually very dirty. So you have to take time
                        to clean it properly. To do this, you get a new razor
                        blade and scrape the outer part of the goat head properly.
                        After this, you can carefully slash open the sides of the
                        mouth of the goat head. This makes it easier to pull the
                        jaws apart, exposing the tongue and the other inner parts
                        of the head.
                        Scrape the tongue also with the blade to remove the reminant
                        meal left behind before the goat was killed. Soak the head
                        in salted hot water for about 20 minutes and wash properly
                        with clean water and focusing more on the teeth, tongue,
                        ears, and every other part of the head. Use a new iron
                        sponge if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place the washed head in a pot and add some chopped onions,
                        2 seasoning cubes and salt to taste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook for about 30-45 minutes till it gets soft.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once it's properly done, squeeze the skin off the head and
                        it will come off easily exposing the skull.
                    </li>
                </ol>
